** Moving to llms , starting with small projects to advance projects.**

**This is  a simple model using some tokenizer and quantization where 
"""
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"

""" is 4bit and using double quant.


 I hope i will learn more advace techniques
